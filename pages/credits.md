**Dramay** is a minimal computing ([minicomp](https://github.com/minicomp)) project by [Elliot Montpellier](https://github.com/emontp), at the University of Pennsylvania.

Pakistani dramas builds upon [Wax](https://github.com/minicomp/wax), an amazing minicomp tool by [Marii Nyr√∂p](http://marii.info/) and [Alex Gil](https://github.com/elotroalex), based on the earlier work of [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and others. It uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/).

If you like the Wax minimal computing idea, [fork the project for yourself on GitHub](https://github.com/minicomp/wax). If you encounter any issue with the Wax software, help out by [creating an issue](https://github.com/minicomp/wax/issues) on the Wax repository or post a comment on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/minicomp/wax/).
