**This is a mini digital exhibit of the digital worlds of Pakistani dramas**   

The idea behind this exhibit is to reorient the spaces of social media into a different kind of visual experience, one which
simultaneously elevate the born-digital quasi-ephemeral images that we *scroll and click* through on our *feeds* to a more
academic setting (that we may more often associate with manuscripts, artefacts, and archival images). The aim is both take these images seriously, as important records of always emergent cultural history, and to structure them in new ways to dislocate, remediate, and critique their situatedness in the mediated spaces where the initially were produced and circulated.
